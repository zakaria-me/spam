# What is it?

It's a software/script that generates a random string of characters that serves as a strong password.

## A strong password

The most common passwords (basic alphanumeric) can be guessed in a matter of seconds (test ?). The solidity and resilience of a password is measured by the time an attacker could take to break it. The solidity of the password is proportionnal to the time it would take the attacker to guess it.

- Length: A good password is at least 8 characters long.Â  A 7 characters long password that consists of alphanumeric characters takes 3 hours to guess. A 8 characters long password takes 10 days.
- Diversity: Mix the characters, use lower alphabet letters, capital letters, numbers, special characters,...
- Accessibility: Make your passwords secret and never let anyone have access to them.
